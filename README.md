# SiliTune - the CPU Power Manager

**WARNING: Use as your own risk. Get prepared to see your laptop on fire or freeze.**

You want your laptop CPU works like a beast when your program is being run, and consume as less power as possible when you are on battery just browsing the net. You don't want to open a terminal and type a long command just to disable turbo boost. 

With this program, you can control your CPU with just a click of mouse, and automatically switch management profiles when power cable disconnected/connected. 

Functions to be developed:

- [ ] Enable/disable turbo boost

- [ ] Turn on/off CPU cores

- [ ] Undervolting

- [ ] TDP level configuration

- [ ] Auto switch profile, handle ACPI events

- [ ] Easy TLP/PowerTOP toggle
